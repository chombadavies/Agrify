                     <p>The project has awarded 38 subgrantees drawn from Non-profit organizations (NGOs), Community-Based Organizations (CBOs) and Faith-based Organizations (FBOs. The subgrantees has exposed KALRO technologies to the network of the subgrantees spread across 22 counties (Kwale, Kilifi, , Marsabit, Isiolo, Tharaka Nithi, Kitui, Machakos, Makueni, Nyandarua, Kirinyaga, Murangâ€™a, West Pokot,  Baringo, Laikipia, Narok, Kajiado, Bomet, Kakamega, Siaya, Kisumu, Homa Bay, Migori). This will have a ripple 
                      effect for adoption of the technologies beyond the life of the project.</p>
                      <p>AgriFI CS APP adopted the Agriculture Value Chain Approach business model to accelerate the adoption of technologies. To date, the project has created over 46,000 jobs against the target of 48,000 jobs, while farmers and actors along the value chain have earned over KES 759 million in incomes mainly generated at the farm level. </p>

                        <p>Further, partners have reached over 9 million farmers indirectly through mass media campaigns against a target of 500,000 while 53,000 farmers have been reached directly through meetings and trainings. Moreover, our partners have linked 23,374 farmers to the financial services (10,194 farmers in the formal financial institutions-banks, Saccos, 13,063 farmers in informal savings groups/village banks). Since the start of project in 2019 the farmers have accessed loans worth KES 12,471,305 through formal (banks, SACCOS) and informal financial service providers village savings and loans. </p>
                        <p> The project has created impact along the value chain to both implementing partners and the farmer. AgriFI CS APP partners are non-profit organization that implements charity-oriented projects. AgriFI CS APP project introduced partners to Agricultural Value Chain approach that involves working with actors along the value chain (Input suppliers, financial service providers, off-takers and policy makers).

<p>In this regard, the partners adopted the value chain model and made significant progress in creating linkages with input suppliers, financial service providers and off takers of the produce. For example, the sorghum value chain partners (STIPA, Caritas Nyahururu) are working with East Africa Malting Limited to produce sorghum for the breweries, West Pokot Galla Goat Breeders Association (WPGGBA) signed an agreement with Equity bank to pre-finance input supplies from PAVES agro dealers in Makutano, West Pokot County agro-dealers and members are benefiting from discounted prices of inputs, and are delivered closer to the villages at the negotiated price.  </p>

    <p>The Value Chain Approach business model has accelerated adoption of technologies by 33,434 farmers. The farmers are now more organized than before the project. Partners that were previously working with adhoc groups have gone a step further to form groups or strengthen existing groups. The capacity of the farmer has been enhanced in terms of the ability to apply skills necessary to use the technologies such as; vaccination of birds, orchard management in Mango, Cashew and Avocado, and use of Integrated pest management Practices (IPM) in Avocado and Mango value chains, top-working, grafting, feed formulation, </p>
      <p>growing seaweed, conservation agriculture, planting, post-harvest activities- Use of hematic bags to store cereals, construction of hay barns, Fish cage fabrication in the ocean and lakes. Some groups for instance; Kamare Dairy Goats in Kitui, Shibe Delta Group and Umoja kibokoni group in Kilifi County are keeping good records of their activities and formulating fish feeds. </p>
      <p>In conclusion, the project has achieved significant progress despite the challenges on; persistent drought in the ASALs since the year 2020, invasion of locusts and Covid 19 pandemic. However, the intervention Logic is still valid. Revision was done in 2020 to include COVID-19 Mitigation measures and to make indicators realistic and measurable. The project is tracking performance impact indicators. </p>
